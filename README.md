# PATHFINDER-VISUALIZER
It is a Web Application, built on the concepts of Artificial Intelligence, which finds the Shortest Path between 2 Points.<br>
To run the application, visit: https://nandiniagrawal2000.github.io/PathFinder-Visualizer/
<br><br>
This Project was done under Microsoft Engage Program under the guidance of mentor- Phani Kiran, in a team of 2 along with Harshita Malik (username- "harshita-jpg").
<br><br>
There is One Starting Point and Two Destination Points.
<br>
Out of the two Destination Points, the one which is closer to the Starting Point is taken and it forms the shortest path with Starting Position.
The Destination Point which will lead to formation of a shorter path with Starting Point is selected as the Final Position.
<br>
The path created can allow diagonal movement according to selection done by the User.
<br><br>
User can also create obstacles or walls in the way, through which path cannot be formed. The obstacles can also be created using a Random Walls generating button provided. 
<br><br>
This application uses four algorithms: 
<br>
1. Dijkstra Algorithm
2. Breadth First Search Algorithm
3. Greedy Best First Search Algorithm
4. A* Search Algorithm
<br>
User can also select any of the above algorithm for execution and can also choose from a variety of Heuristics.
<br>
It also provieds an option for BiDirectional Search for some algorithms. In this case only one Destination point(red) works and the Alternate Destination(violet-blue) is removed.
<br><br>
The Path Length and the Time Taken is shown at the end of execution of algorithm, along with the animations and Shortest Path. 
<br>
<br>
User can always refer to the Instructions provided! :)
